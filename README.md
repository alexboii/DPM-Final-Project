## Description:
EV3 Mindstorm robot built under the [Lejos] (http://www.lejos.org/) framework for the course ECSE 211 - Design Principles and Methods


## Functionalities:
- Scanning an arena for detection of objects (search algorithm)

- Can pickup up to four Styrofoam blocks to build a tower and drop it off at a designated zone.
- Perform odometry correction
- Avoidance of obstacles (wooden blocks as well as forbidden zones)

## Video demonstration: 

Although this video does not exactly show the robot at its full potential, here's a very entertaining video in which the adversary team attempted to sabotage our run. The result: the most epic robot battle in the history of the ECSE 211 course.
